Please read the [main README](../../README.md) for more background on simulacrum.

The auth0 simulator has been initially written to mimic the responses of a real auth0 server that is called from auth0 client libraries like [auth0/react](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react/01-login) and [auth0-spa-js](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-spa-js) that use the OpenID [authorization code flow](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/).

If this does not meet your needs then please create a github issue to start a conversation about adding new OpenID flows.

## Quick Start

This quick start assumes you have your own app with Auth0.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The Auth0 clients expect the server to be served as `https`, and will throw an error if it is served as `http`. Currently, we rely on a certificate available in the home directory. On first run, you will see instructions on how to set up this certificate through `mkcert`.

### Using Default User

You may start a server directly from the command line.

```bash
npx @simulacrum/auth0-simulator  # this will start a simulation server at http://localhost:4400
```

Given no further input, it will use the default values as below. This will point your app at the simulation instead of the Auth0 endpoint.

```json
{
  "domain": "https://localhost:4400",
  "clientId": "00000000000000000000000000000000",
  "audience": "https://thefrontside.auth0.com/api/v1/"
}
```

You now have a running auth0 server!

### Code

You may import and run the simulation server in a script.

```js
import { simulation } from "@simulacrum/auth0-simulator";

const app = simulation();
app.listen(4400, () =>
  console.log(`auth0 simulation server started at https://localhost:4400`)
);
```

By passing an `initialState`, you may control the initial users in the store.

### Example

The folks at Auth0 maintain many samples such as [github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-react-samples](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-react-samples). Follow the instructions to run the sample, set the configuration in `auth_config.json` to match the defaults as noted above, and run the Auth0 simulation server with `npx auth0-simulator`.

## Configuration

The Auth0 Simulator uses [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/cosmiconfig/cosmiconfig) to load the configuration options. This provides many options in where to place your configuration. Using the module name, `auth0Simulator`, you could, for example, set your configuration in a `.auth0Simulatorrc.json` file.

### Options

The `options` field supports the [auth0 configuration fields](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/vanillajs#configure-auth0). The option fields should match the fields in the client application that is calling the auth0 server.

The `scope` also accepts an array of objects containing `clientId`, `scope` and optionally `audience` to enable dynamic scopes from a single simulator. This should allow multiple clients to all use the same simulator. Additionally, setting the `clientId: "default"` will enable a default fallback scope so every client does not need to be included.

An optional [`rulesDirectory` field](#rules) can specify a directory of [auth0 rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules) code files, more on this [below](#rules).

### Rules

It is possible to run [auth0 rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules) if the compiled code files are on disk and all located in the same directory.

Set the `rulesDirectory` of the [options field](#options) to a path relative to your current working directory.

For example, a [sample rules directory](./test/rules) is in the auth0 package for testing.

If we want to run these rules files then we would add the `rulesDirectory` field to the [options object](#options).

## Endpoints

The following endpoints have been assigned handlers:

- `/authorize`
- `/login`
- `/u/login`
- `/usernamepassword/login`
- `/login/callback`
- `/oauth/token`
- `/v2/logout`
- `/.well-known/jwks.json`
- `/.well-known/openid-configuration`
