# @simulacrum/server

Server capable of running multiple concurrent simulations that can be controlled by test cases, preview apps, and local developer environments.

> [!WARNING]  
> The server is undergoing a refactor, and this may not be required for your use case. The refactor includes allow for more simply running single simulators so this package will be primarily useful as a control plane for cases where there are many simulators under test and in use. For the previous iterations, see the `v0` branch which contain the previous functionality.
